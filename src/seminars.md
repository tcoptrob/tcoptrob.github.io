**Title**: Motor intelligence in soft robots and other unconventional robotic systems

**Abstract**: *Animal motion capabilities remain unmatched despite AI's huge leaps over the past few years. Following this observation, researchers have argued that any solution to the challenge of embodying AI in mechanical systems should not solely focus on the robot's brain and cannot disregard the intelligence in the body. In this talk, I will present examples from my group's research on mechanically intelligent unconventional robotic systems, with a special focus on soft robots. I will present the challenge of controlling these systems and discuss how model-based and data-driven perspectives can synergistically contribute to solving the great challenge of animal-level motion performance in artificial agents.*

**Date**: Friday, February 21st 2025

**Time**: 09:00-10:00 AM EDT
