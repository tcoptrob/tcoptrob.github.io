**Title**: Learning-based control for quadrupedal robots

**Abstract**: *In this talk, I will introduce our recent work on control and planning for quadrupedal robots. Our goal is to develop a dynamic legged robot capable of autonomously traversing complex and unstructured terrains. Achieving this requires a robust vision system, a path planner that integrates both geometric and semantic information, and a reliable controller that remains effective even with noisy perception data. Additionally, all these components must bridge the sim-to-real gap to ensure reliable performance on the real robot. I will discuss our efforts in achieving these goals with our quadrupedal robot, Raibo.*

**Date**: Thursday, March 13th 2025

**Time**: 09:00-10:00 AM EDT
