# 2023-2024 Seminar Series

[Link to older Seminar Series](seminars_old.md)

## Upcoming Seminar

**Speaker**: Yuval Tassa (Google DeepMind)

**Title**: MJPC: Asynchronous UI for real-time behavior synthesis

**Abstract**:

*Model-free, learning-based methods are simple and powerful but inherently slow. Model-based predictive control methods can synthesize behavior in real time, but are considered difficult to understand, implement and use.*

*In this talk I will present MuJoCo MPC (MJPC), a fully open-source interactive application and software framework for predictive control that lets the user easily author and solve complex robotics tasks. MJPC is a rich GUI application, giving the user real-time visual feedback and allowing them to develop intuitions about the underlying algorithm. Importantly, the interactive simulation can be slowed-down asynchronously—effectively speeding up the controller—leading to a democratization of predictive control tooling.*

*In closing, I will discuss various ways in which model-based and model-free methods can be combined, exploiting the strengths of both approaches.*

*The talk will include a live demo of multiple locomotion and manipulation tasks solved from scratch, in real-time, on a laptop.*

**Date**: Friday, December 1st 2023

**Time**: 10:00-11:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)
