# Best Paper Award Finalists and Winner

**Winner:**

- **Do Differentiable Simulators Give Better Policy Gradients?** by *H.J. Terry Suh, Max Simchowitz, Kaiqing Zhan, and Russ Tedrake*

**Finalists:**

- **Collision detection accelerated: An optimization perspective** by *Louis Montaut, Quentin Le Lidec, Vladimir Petrik, Josef Sivic and Justin Carpentier*

- **Analytical Second-Order Partial Derivatives of Rigid-Body Inverse Dynamics** by *Shubham Singh, Ryan P. Russell and Patrick M. Wensing*

Congratulations to all the authors!

This year was the first time the award was coming with a cash prize (500$).

We got a record number of 37 submissions and 12 were selected for jury evaluation. The quality of the papers was particularly high.

One of the papers was co-signed by a TC co-chair so, following the award rules, we asked a jury member from last year to rule on its selection. We would like to thank *Prof. Jaeheung Park* for handling this matter.

The jury members this year were *Dr. Andrea Del Prete, Prof. Jessy Grizzle, Dr. hae-Won Park, Prof. Nancy Pollard, Dr. Michael Posa and Dr. Yuval Tassa*. A warm thank you to them.
