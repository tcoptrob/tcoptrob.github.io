# TC Virtual Poster Session and Networking Event 2025

## Overview

The Technical Committee on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics will hold the annual Summer virtual poster session and networking event on **Thursday, July 24th, 2025 (9:00-11:30 AM EDT, 3:00-5:30 PM CEST, 10:00 PM - 12:30 AM JST)**. There will also be a Best Poster Award associated with the event, consisting of USD $250 that can be used within 2025 (until December 31st) for expenses eligible to be reimbursed by IEEE for the purpose of attending an IEEE-RAS conference (e.g. travel, conference fees, meals). The award will be selected at the end of the event.
