# Upcoming Events for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics

The TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics is happy to announce a few upcoming events and initiatives to support our community.

## TC In-Person Connections and Happy Hour at ICRA 2023

Mark you calendars for **Thursday night (June 1st) from 6:30-8pm local time**, immediately following the end of programming, we are going to be hosting a happy hour and a half at the DoubleTree by Hilton London ExCeL a short 5 minute walk from the conference venue. Join us for great conversations and make sure to get there early as appetizers and drinks are on us until we hit our budget! And, if you need even more reason to attend, we’ll be announcing the winners of the 2022 TC Best Paper Award at the event! Finally, we’ll also be helping members of the TC get connected during ICRA by sharing which TC members are attending. [Please RSVP for the happy hour and let us know if you're coming to ICRA on this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeknt2n6bVWP_Ef2S5RQpM3zzkN3F_FMtnud0kMoV9O3C99sA/viewform).

## TC Virtual Poster Session and Networking Event

After two years of successful virtual poster sessions we’re back for round three on **Tuesday July 11th from 1pm-3:30pm UTC**. Save the date and time now and look out for emails soliciting poster submissions and providing more details on the event after the conclusion of ICRA.

**Hope to see you online or in person soon!**
