# TC Happy Hour at IROS 2023 (Monday Oct. 2 at 6:00PM)

The Technical Committee (TC) on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics and the TC on Humanoid Robotics are **co-organizing an in-person networking event at IROS 2023**.

Mark your calendars for **Monday night (October 2nd) from 6:00-8:00 pm local time**, immediately following the end of programming, we are going to be hosting a happy (two) hours at the [**Anchor Bar in Detroit**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g42139-d389815-Reviews-Anchor_Bar-Detroit_Michigan.html), near the conference venue. 

There will be heavy appetizers and an open bar sponsored by the TCs. **No registration is required**, just feel free to come and drop in during the event time, and make sure you get there before we finish our budget!! 

*We also encourage the students (Masters/PhD) to attend the social event as we will announce some new opportunities for them to contribute to our TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics efforts.*

Hope to see many of you at the event in IROS!
