But the challenges waiting for today's robots require them to automatically generate and control a wide range of behaviors in order to be more flexible and adaptive to changing environments. Optimization or optimal control offers an interesting way to generate behaviors automatically based on elementary principles (cost functions, constraints).

However, control theoretic approaches to solving nonlinear differential games struggle with the \"curse of dimensionality.\" We will explore two methods for overcoming this issue, one with conservative guarantees and one with probabilistic guarantees.</p> <p>Recently, the applied math community has been exploring the use of the Hopf formula for efficiently solving linear differential games with bounded inputs via ADMM. We will show how we can lift a nonlinear game to a linear space wherein we can bound linearization error. We can then treat this error as an adversary in a linear game solvable by the Hopf formula, with results that can map back to the original space for conservative guarantees on the true nonlinear game. More recently, solving HJ reachability using model-based supervised learning via physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has become increasingly popular because the computation time scales with complexity rather than dimensionality. However, these PINNs suffer from learning errors and catastrophic forgetting. We will show how linear supervision (e.g. from the same Hopf formula above) of the nonlinear game can significantly improve the learning results, resulting in tighter probabilistic guarantees.

It provides a consistent and flexible way to formalise and solve complex problems in robotics, ranging from simulation to learning and control. While writing optimisation solvers was initially the job of specialists in optimisation, the past few years have seen the emergence of new solvers developed by roboticists, and for robotics. This paradigm change corresponds to a turning point in the community, justified by the absence of off-the-shelf solvers capable of precisely and efficiently handling the specific features of robotic problems. In this talk, I will present a general overview of our recent contributions to optimisation for robotics. In the first part, I will first review contributions around the development of generic and efficient solvers to tackle a wide variety of optimisation problems arising in robotics, ranging from standard quadratic problems (QPs) to nonlinear problems (NLPs) and trajectory optimisation problems (TO). The second part will deal with physical simulation. I will highlight recent progress to improve simulator accuracy and efficiency and draw some perspectives about differentiating physics, which is by nature non-smooth.</p> <p>Date: Friday, February 17th</p> <p>Time: 10:00 - 11:00AM EST (GMT -5:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-03-14/","title":"Fourth Seminar in Virtual Seminar Series Scheduled","text":"<p>We have our fourth seminar for the TC seminar series on Friday (March 24th 2023) at 13:00 EDT (GMT -4:00). Please find the flyer with all the details at this link.</p> <p>Speaker: Nathan Ratliff</p> <p>Title: On the Geometric Foundations of Continuous Control</p> <p>Abstract: In 2022, Bertsekas made a deep observation in Lessons from AlphaZero. He showed that finite-horizon optimization over an actor-critic network is a powerful Newton step on the Bellman equation. In continuous control, this observation is salient because it provides a unifying perspective on optimal control and reinforcement learning, two workhorses which have separately been extremely successful in the field. In this talk, we argue that these observations will shape decision systems into the future, and rather than optimizing over standard physical dynamics, optimal control methods will move toward optimizing more generally over increasingly sophisticated models of behavioral dynamics that capture not only physics but also the statistics (a memory) of past optimal control solutions. We present a class of behavioral dynamics functions called geometric fabrics which build off the geometric properties of classical mechanics to create expressive path priors for statistically efficient behavior synthesis. We show both how to manually design these fabrics to capture relevant engineered behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, end-effector attraction, posturing, etc., and how to learn the fabrics from demonstration, achieving striking sample efficiencies from their geometric inductive bias. Bertsekas\u2019s results are observations on the structure of abstract dynamic programming and apply equally well to discrete systems like AlphaZero and continuous systems like those of robotics. But to leverage them effectively in robotics, we need to better understand how to efficiently encode information into the continuous time differential equations that govern robotic behavior. Geometric fabrics are a step in that direction.</p> <p>Date: Friday, March 24th, 2023</p> <p>Time: 13:00 - 14:00 EDT (GMT -4:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-04-23/","title":"Fifth Seminar in Virtual Seminar Series Scheduled","text":"<p>We have our fifth seminar for the TC seminar series on Friday (April 28th 2023) at 09:00 EDT (GMT -4:00).

Numerous control algorithms in the form of MPC, taking into account the unique characteristics and nature of legged robots, have been proposed and successfully validated on real robot hardware. In this presentation, I will presents a model predictive control algorithm implemented in two different robotic platforms developed in our lab: KAIST HOUND, a fast-running quadruped robot, and MARVEL, an agile and versatile climbing legged robot. A single MPC algorithm effectively controls both hardware systems with a small modification of contact force conditions. Furthermore, I will provide an overview of a novel MPC algorithm that does not rely on a fixed foot sequence. This MPC algorithm incorporates contact dynamics and its analytical gradient in its formulation to obtain the control input without a predefined gait sequence.</p> <p>Speaker 2: Ioannis Havoutis</p> <p>Title: Learning and optimization for locomanipulation with quadrupedal robots</p> <p>Abstract: Legged robots have made tremendous progress in the last few years and are now taking their first steps in a range of applications. Their key advantage is the unmatched mobility that legged locomotion provides and the versatility this offers as a platform for both sensing and manipulation. These, however, require control solutions that are able to recover from unexpected perturbations, adapt to variations in system and environment dynamics, and execute tasks safely and reliably. In this talk I will give an overview of my groups' work on optimization- and learning-based approaches to locomotion and manipulation on legged robots. In addition, I will briefly touch on our engagement with industrial partners and the applications we are pursuing.</p> <p>Date: Friday, April 28th, 2023</p> <p>Time: 09:00 EDT (GMT -4:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-05-17/","title":"Upcoming Events for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics","text":"<p>The TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics is happy to announce a few upcoming events and initiatives to support our community.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-05-17/#tc-in-person-connections-and-happy-hour-at-icra-2023","title":"TC In-Person Connections and Happy Hour at ICRA 2023","text":"<p>Mark you calendars for Thursday night (June 1st) from 6:30-8pm local time, immediately following the end of programming, we are going to be hosting a happy hour and a half at the DoubleTree by Hilton London ExCeL a short 5 minute walk from the conference venue.

Contact is either avoided at all cost or established at vanishing speed. There are several reasons for this to happen: an important one is the lack of suitable hardware. Robot physical components, especially joints and transmissions, need to be made resilient to collisions by design in order not to get damaged. However, recent hardware developments, including those in the area of soft robotics, are rapidly changing the hardware landscape. Modern robot hardware is starting to showcase the possibility of sustaining and thus exploiting impacts. A clear and well-known example is Boston Dynamics' humanoid robot ATLAS, performing acrobatic moves such as somersaults and jumps. The availability of impact-resilient hardware opens up possibilities to develop and validate new impact-aware manipulation and locomotion strategies. Strategies where contact between the robot and irs surrounding environment is intentionally established at desired non-negligible speed to achieve user-defined motion objectives. The exploitation of intentional impacts is particularly appealing for reducing a task's execution time. But also for reducing energy consumption due to the lack of fast decelerations and acceleration traditionally required to stop the robot at contact time and to make it move again after contact has been established. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the research carried out at the TU/e on this fascinating new field of research, specifically focusing on impact-aware control and post-impact velocity prediction aspects.</p> <p>Date: Wednesday, January 31st 2024</p> <p>Time: 09:00-10:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-02-09/","title":"2023 TC Best Paper Award","text":"<p>We have opened the nomination window for this year's TC Best Paper award, which will come with a $500 travel award for the winner!

In addition, robots should display such capabilities in real time, which entails the ability to continuously learn from small numbers of demonstrations and/or interactions. In this context, the quality and efficiency of robot learning approaches may be improved via the introduction of inductive bias. In this talk, I will view inductive bias through the lens of geometry, which is ubiquitous in robotics. Specifically, I will discuss via three examples how geometry-based inductive bias can be introduced into robot learning from data structures, from physics, and from human knowledge. First, I will show that the performance of various algorithms may be improved by considering the intrinsic geometric characteristics of data. Second, I will discuss how the dynamic properties of humans and robots are straightforwardly accounted for by considering physics-based geometric configuration spaces. Finally, I will show that imposing an additional geometric structure to probabilistic latent spaces allows us to learn low-dimensional representations of robotics taxonomies in continuous domains from which we can generate realistic motions.</p> <p>Date: Friday, February 23rd 2024</p> <p>Time: 10:00-11:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-03-11/","title":"Fourth Seminar in 2023-2024 Seminar Series","text":"<p>We're excited to continue our virtual seminar series for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics.</p> <p>We'll have a talk from Ludovic Righetti from New York University (NYU) at 9AM EST March 14th 2024 (Thursday).

While MPC is a rigorous framework to generate, in principle, any kind of behavior from a single algorithm, major limitations remain. For example, current approaches do not allow easy inclusion of multi-modal sensing, especially visual and force feedback, and algorithms struggle to optimize in real-time multi-contact behaviors necessary for complex manipulation or locomotion. On the other hand, learning-based methodologies, which heavily rely on offline compute, do not seem to struggle with these issues. In this talk, I will present our recent work tackling those problems with a particular eye towards unifying learning and numerical optimal control. First, I will argue for the benefits of \u201ctextbook\u201d numerical optimization methods to develop reliable solvers. Then I will discuss how to include multi-modal sensing and accelerate the computation of multi-contact behaviors through a mixture of offline compute (learning) and online optimization (MPC). I will then show how this can lead to improved performance for movement generation in the context of locomotion and manipulation and discuss on-going challenges.</p> <p>Date: Thursday, March 14th 2024</p> <p>Time: 09:00-10:00 AM EDT</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-04-08/","title":"Last Seminar in 2023-2024 Seminar Series","text":"<p>We're excited to announce our last seminar in our virtual seminar series for this year for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics.</p> <p>We'll have a talk by Prof. Toshiyuki Ohtsuka from Kyoto University at 9AM EDT April 19th 2024 (Friday).

In particular, nonlinear MPC (NMPC) has been gaining attention due to its applications to complex nonlinear mechanical systems. Additionally, software tools for NMPC have rapidly developed to facilitate its implementation. In this talk, I will first present a comprehensive overview of real-time optimization algorithms, software tools, and applications of NMPC. One of the key ideas there is exploiting the smoothness of nonlinearities in problems. Then, I will present recent advances in parallel computation methods for NMPC and an application of NMPC for whole-body control of a quadruped robot with switches and state jumps. Furthermore, I will also introduce ongoing work on computation methods for more general optimal control problems involving equilibrium constraints or signal temporal logic specifications, which appear in various problems in robotics.</p> <p>Date: Friday, April 19th 2024</p> <p>Time: 09:00-10:00 AM EDT</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-06-12-best-paper/","title":"Best Paper Award Finalists and Winner","text":"<p>Winners (tied):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Motion planning around obstacles with convex optimization, by T.
