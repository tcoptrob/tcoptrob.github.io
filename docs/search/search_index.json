Contact is either avoided at all cost or established at vanishing speed. There are several reasons for this to happen: an important one is the lack of suitable hardware. Robot physical components, especially joints and transmissions, need to be made resilient to collisions by design in order not to get damaged. However, recent hardware developments, including those in the area of soft robotics, are rapidly changing the hardware landscape. Modern robot hardware is starting to showcase the possibility of sustaining and thus exploiting impacts. A clear and well-known example is Boston Dynamics' humanoid robot ATLAS, performing acrobatic moves such as somersaults and jumps. The availability of impact-resilient hardware opens up possibilities to develop and validate new impact-aware manipulation and locomotion strategies. Strategies where contact between the robot and irs surrounding environment is intentionally established at desired non-negligible speed to achieve user-defined motion objectives. The exploitation of intentional impacts is particularly appealing for reducing a task's execution time. But also for reducing energy consumption due to the lack of fast decelerations and acceleration traditionally required to stop the robot at contact time and to make it move again after contact has been established. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the research carried out at the TU/e on this fascinating new field of research, specifically focusing on impact-aware control and post-impact velocity prediction aspects.</p> <p>Date: Wednesday, January 31st 2024</p> <p>Time: 09:00-10:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p>"},{"location":"seminars/#line-up-and-video-links","title":"Line-Up and Video Links","text":"Date Speaker Title YouTube Dec. 1, 2023 Yuval Tassa MJPC: Asynchronous UI for real-time behavior synthesis (link) Jan. 31, 2024 Alessandro Saccon Impact-Aware Manipulation: Exploiting Intentional Collisions to Speed Up Task Execution Feb. 23, 2024 No\u00e9mie Jaquier TBA Mar. 14, 2024 Ludovic Righetti TBA Apr. 19, 2024 Toshiyuki Ohtsuka TBA"},{"location":"seminars_old/","title":"Archive of Seminar Series","text":""},{"location":"seminars_old/#2022-2023","title":"2022-2023","text":""},{"location":"seminars_old/#line-up-and-video-links","title":"Line-Up and Video Links","text":"Date Speaker Title YouTube Nov. 18, 2022 Zac Manchester Composable Optimization for Robotic Motion Planning and Control (link) Jan. 13, 2023 Carlos Mastalli Building athletic intelligence in legged robots: a top-down approach (link) Majid Khadiv Optimal Control and Learning for Agile Locomotion (link) Feb. 17, 2023 Justin Carpentier Progress and prospects in optimization for control and learning in robotics (link) Mar. 24, 2023 Nathan Ratliff On the Geometric Foundations of Continuous Control (link) Apr. 28, 2023 Hae-won Park Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots: From Fast Quadruped Locomotion to Agile Climbing Systems (link) Ioannis Havoutis Learning and optimization for locomanipulation with quadrupedal robots (link)"},{"location":"news/","title":"News","text":"<p>{{ blog_content news }}</p>"},{"location":"news/2022-11-16/","title":"New Virtual Seminar Series starting November 18, 2022","text":"<p>The Technical Committee on Model-Based Optimization for robotics is excited to kick off a new virtual seminar series.</p> <p>We'll be getting started with a talk from Zac Machester of CMU at 10AM EST on Friday November 18th.

It provides a consistent and flexible way to formalise and solve complex problems in robotics, ranging from simulation to learning and control. While writing optimisation solvers was initially the job of specialists in optimisation, the past few years have seen the emergence of new solvers developed by roboticists, and for robotics. This paradigm change corresponds to a turning point in the community, justified by the absence of off-the-shelf solvers capable of precisely and efficiently handling the specific features of robotic problems. In this talk, I will present a general overview of our recent contributions to optimisation for robotics. In the first part, I will first review contributions around the development of generic and efficient solvers to tackle a wide variety of optimisation problems arising in robotics, ranging from standard quadratic problems (QPs) to nonlinear problems (NLPs) and trajectory optimisation problems (TO). The second part will deal with physical simulation. I will highlight recent progress to improve simulator accuracy and efficiency and draw some perspectives about differentiating physics, which is by nature non-smooth.</p> <p>Date: Friday, February 17th</p> <p>Time: 10:00 - 11:00AM EST (GMT -5:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-03-14/","title":"Fourth Seminar in Virtual Seminar Series Scheduled","text":"<p>We have our fourth seminar for the TC seminar series on Friday (March 24th 2023) at 13:00 EDT (GMT -4:00). Please find the flyer with all the details at this link.</p> <p>Speaker: Nathan Ratliff</p> <p>Title: On the Geometric Foundations of Continuous Control</p> <p>Abstract: In 2022, Bertsekas made a deep observation in Lessons from AlphaZero. He showed that finite-horizon optimization over an actor-critic network is a powerful Newton step on the Bellman equation. In continuous control, this observation is salient because it provides a unifying perspective on optimal control and reinforcement learning, two workhorses which have separately been extremely successful in the field. In this talk, we argue that these observations will shape decision systems into the future, and rather than optimizing over standard physical dynamics, optimal control methods will move toward optimizing more generally over increasingly sophisticated models of behavioral dynamics that capture not only physics but also the statistics (a memory) of past optimal control solutions. We present a class of behavioral dynamics functions called geometric fabrics which build off the geometric properties of classical mechanics to create expressive path priors for statistically efficient behavior synthesis. We show both how to manually design these fabrics to capture relevant engineered behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, end-effector attraction, posturing, etc., and how to learn the fabrics from demonstration, achieving striking sample efficiencies from their geometric inductive bias. Bertsekas\u2019s results are observations on the structure of abstract dynamic programming and apply equally well to discrete systems like AlphaZero and continuous systems like those of robotics. But to leverage them effectively in robotics, we need to better understand how to efficiently encode information into the continuous time differential equations that govern robotic behavior. Geometric fabrics are a step in that direction.</p> <p>Date: Friday, March 24th, 2023</p> <p>Time: 13:00 - 14:00 EDT (GMT -4:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-04-23/","title":"Fifth Seminar in Virtual Seminar Series Scheduled","text":"<p>We have our fifth seminar for the TC seminar series on Friday (April 28th 2023) at 09:00 EDT (GMT -4:00).

Numerous control algorithms in the form of MPC, taking into account the unique characteristics and nature of legged robots, have been proposed and successfully validated on real robot hardware. In this presentation, I will presents a model predictive control algorithm implemented in two different robotic platforms developed in our lab: KAIST HOUND, a fast-running quadruped robot, and MARVEL, an agile and versatile climbing legged robot. A single MPC algorithm effectively controls both hardware systems with a small modification of contact force conditions. Furthermore, I will provide an overview of a novel MPC algorithm that does not rely on a fixed foot sequence. This MPC algorithm incorporates contact dynamics and its analytical gradient in its formulation to obtain the control input without a predefined gait sequence.</p> <p>Speaker 2: Ioannis Havoutis</p> <p>Title: Learning and optimization for locomanipulation with quadrupedal robots</p> <p>Abstract: Legged robots have made tremendous progress in the last few years and are now taking their first steps in a range of applications. Their key advantage is the unmatched mobility that legged locomotion provides and the versatility this offers as a platform for both sensing and manipulation. These, however, require control solutions that are able to recover from unexpected perturbations, adapt to variations in system and environment dynamics, and execute tasks safely and reliably. In this talk I will give an overview of my groups' work on optimization- and learning-based approaches to locomotion and manipulation on legged robots. In addition, I will briefly touch on our engagement with industrial partners and the applications we are pursuing.</p> <p>Date: Friday, April 28th, 2023</p> <p>Time: 09:00 EDT (GMT -4:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-05-17/","title":"Upcoming Events for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics","text":"<p>The TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics is happy to announce a few upcoming events and initiatives to support our community.</p>"},{"location":"news/2023-05-17/#tc-in-person-connections-and-happy-hour-at-icra-2023","title":"TC In-Person Connections and Happy Hour at ICRA 2023","text":"<p>Mark you calendars for Thursday night (June 1st) from 6:30-8pm local time, immediately following the end of programming, we are going to be hosting a happy hour and a half at the DoubleTree by Hilton London ExCeL a short 5 minute walk from the conference venue.

Model-based predictive control methods can synthesize behavior in real time, but are considered difficult to understand, implement and use.</p> <p>In this talk I will present MuJoCo MPC (MJPC), a fully open-source interactive application and software framework for predictive control that lets the user easily author and solve complex robotics tasks. MJPC is a rich GUI application, giving the user real-time visual feedback and allowing them to develop intuitions about the underlying algorithm. Importantly, the interactive simulation can be slowed-down asynchronously\u2014effectively speeding up the controller\u2014leading to a democratization of predictive control tooling.</p> <p>In closing, I will discuss various ways in which model-based and model-free methods can be combined, exploiting the strengths of both approaches.</p> <p>The talk will include a live demo of multiple locomotion and manipulation tasks solved from scratch, in real-time, on a laptop.</p> <p>Date: Friday, December 1st 2023</p> <p>Time: 10:00-11:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-01-18/","title":"Second Seminar in 2023-2024 Seminar Series","text":"<p>We're excited to continue our virtual seminar series for the TC on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics.</p> <p>We'll have a talk from Alessandro Saccon from TU/e at 9AM EST January 31st 2024 (Wednesday).

Contact is either avoided at all cost or established at vanishing speed. There are several reasons for this to happen: an important one is the lack of suitable hardware. Robot physical components, especially joints and transmissions, need to be made resilient to collisions by design in order not to get damaged. However, recent hardware developments, including those in the area of soft robotics, are rapidly changing the hardware landscape. Modern robot hardware is starting to showcase the possibility of sustaining and thus exploiting impacts. A clear and well-known example is Boston Dynamics' humanoid robot ATLAS, performing acrobatic moves such as somersaults and jumps. The availability of impact-resilient hardware opens up possibilities to develop and validate new impact-aware manipulation and locomotion strategies. Strategies where contact between the robot and irs surrounding environment is intentionally established at desired non-negligible speed to achieve user-defined motion objectives. The exploitation of intentional impacts is particularly appealing for reducing a task's execution time. But also for reducing energy consumption due to the lack of fast decelerations and acceleration traditionally required to stop the robot at contact time and to make it move again after contact has been established. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the research carried out at the TU/e on this fascinating new field of research, specifically focusing on impact-aware control and post-impact velocity prediction aspects.</p> <p>Date: Wednesday, January 31st 2024</p> <p>Time: 09:00-10:00 AM EST (GMT -05:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-02-09/","title":"2023 TC Best Paper Award","text":"<p>We have opened the nomination window for this year's TC Best Paper award, which will come with a $500 travel award for the winner!
