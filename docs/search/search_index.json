But the challenges waiting for today's robots require them to automatically generate and control a wide range of behaviors in order to be more flexible and adaptive to changing environments. Optimization or optimal control offers an interesting way to generate behaviors automatically based on elementary principles (cost functions, constraints). Moore's law as well as recent developments in optimization algorithms and in particular real-time optimization make a wider application of algorithmic optimization a realistic option even for real-time control in complex robotic applications in the near future.</p> <p></p> <p>Important research areas promoted by the TC Model-based optimization for Robotics include:</p> <ul> <li>Optimization-based generation of robot trajectories using dynamical models of the robot and its environment</li> <li>Improve the behavior style of robots by optimization, in particular for humanoid robots (induce natural behavior)</li> <li>Online motion control using real-time model-based optimization and model predictive control/receding horizon control</li> <li>Development of appropriate dynamical models for offline and online optimization</li> <li>Learning/improving models during optimization</li> <li>Inverse optimal control techniques for the identification of objective functions</li> <li>Robust optimal control and refinement of optimal controls based on actual experience</li> <li>Combination of optimization and machine learning approaches</li> <li>Combination of optimization and path planning methods</li> <li>This interdisciplinary scope includes establishing bridges to the mathematical optimization community as well as to the field of biomechanics (to learn from biology and to identify optimality criteria) and to computer graphics (for promising optimization approaches on physically realistic models).</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":""},{"location":"contact/#workshop-endorsement-request","title":"Workshop Endorsement Request","text":"<p>If you are organizing a workshop and would like a letter of support from the TC, please complete the following form: (link)</p>"},{"location":"contact/#contribute-to-the-tc","title":"Contribute to the TC","text":"<p>If you would like to contribute with projects, publications, tools, or any resources you think may be of interest to the community, you can use this form: (link).</p>"},{"location":"contact/#email","title":"Email","text":"<p>tc.opt.rob@gmail.com</p>"},{"location":"contact/#co-chairs","title":"Co-Chairs","text":""},{"location":"contact/#sylvain-calinon","title":"Sylvain Calinon","text":"<p>Affiliation: Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland</p> <p>email: sylvain.calinon@idiap.ch</p>"},{"location":"contact/#adrien-escande","title":"Adrien Escande","text":"<p>Affiliation: National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan</p> <p>email: adrien.escande@gmail.com</p>"},{"location":"contact/#yue-hu","title":"Yue Hu","text":"<p>Affiliation: University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada</p> <p>email: yue.hu@uwaterloo.ca</p>"},{"location":"contact/#patrick-m-wensing","title":"Patrick M.

It provides a consistent and flexible way to formalise and solve complex problems in robotics, ranging from simulation to learning and control. While writing optimisation solvers was initially the job of specialists in optimisation, the past few years have seen the emergence of new solvers developed by roboticists, and for robotics. This paradigm change corresponds to a turning point in the community, justified by the absence of off-the-shelf solvers capable of precisely and efficiently handling the specific features of robotic problems. In this talk, I will present a general overview of our recent contributions to optimisation for robotics. In the first part, I will first review contributions around the development of generic and efficient solvers to tackle a wide variety of optimisation problems arising in robotics, ranging from standard quadratic problems (QPs) to nonlinear problems (NLPs) and trajectory optimisation problems (TO). The second part will deal with physical simulation. I will highlight recent progress to improve simulator accuracy and efficiency and draw some perspectives about differentiating physics, which is by nature non-smooth.</p> <p>Date: Friday, February 17th</p> <p>Time: 10:00 - 11:00AM EST (GMT -5:00)</p> <p>Link: https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/91247893326?pwd=L2JWU21aQzc4cU1ZQklEb0QrWGQvdz09</p> <p>More details on upcoming seminars (and video links for past ones) can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"resources/books/","title":"Books","text":""},{"location":"resources/books/#robot-modeling-and-control","title":"Robot Modeling and Control","text":"<ul> <li>Modern Robotics - Mechanics, Planning and Control by Kevin M.
